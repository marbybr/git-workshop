Local PC --> Working directory --> Staging area --> Local repository

Remote repository: Github

Branching: creating multiple versions of your code

terminal:
git status
git add filename: add from working directory to staging directory
git reset: reset from staging directory to working directory
git commit -m "Added script to create dad jokes" (commit on local pc)
git log
git push
git checkout -b development (create or go to branch)
In VSCode, you can see branch in bottom left
git add . (add all files)
git commit -m "Added a docstring"
now two branches:
	- one main, one with docstring
.gitignore: files to be ignored by git
- pull request/merge request: from development branch to main branch (merging development branch back into main branch)
